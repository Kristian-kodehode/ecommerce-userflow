# eCommerce React Flow

This is my first attempt at creating a eCommerce webstore using React.
Obviously the api used is a very small one, but the concept remains the same as it would only be more items to map through.

I have used react and router as well to handle the pages and also the navigation bar.

Challenges i met along the way was quite varied.
Using useParams and also context for the first time properly which was a steep but great learningcurve. Can not wait to explore these options and many more in future projects.

This project will continuosly update due to more functionalities, but for now it has come together quite nicely i think.
